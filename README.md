# CUSTOM CAROUSEL WITH CRA

## About this
This is an example of a custom component, for a carousel implementation, that only needs to receive
an array of objects that have a property called URL, which corresponds to the url of the image to be displayed.

It operates in two modes. Even Elements mode, which renders two images at once and scrolls in two positions through the array elements, and Odd Elements mode, which centers an image while allowing 2/3 of the image on the sides of the container. before and after.
